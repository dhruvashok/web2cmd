The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to translate a website command injection (example: through a GET parameter or cookie) into a functional bash or cmd shell that you can use to execute commands on the server as if you had a shell (hence the name "web2cmd"). This program will alter itself for the Mac, Windows, or Linux operating systems and will attempt to make the process as easy as possible for you. Enjoy!
